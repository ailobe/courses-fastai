# Introduction to Machine Learning

Notebooks from fast.ai's Introduction to Machine Learning course.

This is a free course offered by fast.ai ([currently unlisted](http://forums.fast.ai/t/another-treat-early-access-to-intro-to-machine-learning-videos/6826)). There's a github [repository](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/tree/master/courses/ml1).

I started this project using Google Colab, but I changed to Kaggle [kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/ailobe/kernels).
